# Personal-Research-Assistant

## Objective
Conducting literature surveys is time-consuming for researchers and students who must sift through numerous academic papers. This project develops an application that streamlines the process, allowing users to search arXiv for relevant papers by keywords, authors, or topics, receive concise summaries, and interact with the content through Q&amp;A.
